# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN
The brain tumors, are the most common and aggressive disease, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of patients.   Generally, various image techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound image are used to evaluate the tumor in a brain.   Especially, in this work MRI images are used to diagnose tumor in the brain  The aim of the project is to develop a “Brain Tumor Detection Model” which detects the brain tumor from the given MRI Images using CNN.
